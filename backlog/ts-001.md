# TS-001: Implement a sealed-bid auction in TypeScript

As a fan of privacy,,
In order to maintain my secret identity while bidding,
I want to have the ability to start a sealed auction

Acceptance Criteria:
* All participants can enter their names
* Each participant is asked for a bid
* Bids are not shared or displayed
* After all participants have entered bids, a winner
is declared
* The winner is the person with the highest bid
